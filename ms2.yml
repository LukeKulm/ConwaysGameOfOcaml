  Our project is an implementation of John Conway's 'Game of Life' cellular
  automata. Our implementation follows the standard rules where a 'Dead' cell
  comes alive in the next generation if it has exactly 3 living neighbors. A
  'Live' cell stays alive in the next generation if it has 2 or 3 living
  neighbors, and otherwise dies.

  Our implementation is currently pretty bare-bones, but it does work. Even with
  a simple implementation of Conway's 'Game of Life' the options for variation
  are nearly limitless, and there is a lot that you can play around with. Soon,
  we will make our GUI more interactive. We will also add other customizable
  features such as adjustability for colors and the speed at which the game
  runs.
