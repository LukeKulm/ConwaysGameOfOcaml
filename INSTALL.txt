Installation Instructions:

- Unzip life.zip from the command line. (Which probably had to be done to read
this file)
- Run [opam install graphics] to install the ocaml graphics module.
- Follow the installation prompts as instructed. Note that Mac (and maybe other)
users will very likely have to restart their machines to get XQuartz to work.
- Run [make play] from the directory 'CS3110FinalProject' to spawn the GUI and
then play the game of life.
