Installation Instructions:

- Run [opam install graphics] to install the ocaml graphics module.
- Follow the installation prompts as instructed. Note that Mac (and maybe other)
users will very likely have to restart their machines to get XQuartz to work.
- Unzip life.zip from the command line.
- Run [make play] from the directory 'CS3110FinalProject' to spawn the GUI and
watch a cool demonstration of Conway's Game of Life.
- There are a few different seeds in the code to run, but currently they must be
manually adjusted in display.ml. Easily creating custom seeds will be part of
the next round of adding functionality.
- There is more to come!
